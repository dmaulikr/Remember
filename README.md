# Remember
Remember 2 - The Smart Reminder App

### What is Remember?
Remember is a notes taking app that combines the powers of reminders, photos, and locations all into a single entity. It's designed to be user friendly and powerful. (It doesn't quite meet this goal 100% of the time to be completely honest.)

### Why put this on Github if it's in the App Store?
Because in all honesty, nobody uses Remember and I would rather have it open source an be willing to let people view my code and possibly collaborate to make Remember better.

### Why keep it in the App Store then?
Until Remember actually gets to a point that it provides an experience unlike any other app, then there isn't much of a point in keeping it private. If you'd like to use the application for personal use, then I'm relying on you to use the honor system and pay a measly 99¢ for Remember. That's nearly 4x's less than your super fancy carmel vanilla skim milk iced frappé that you get at Starbucks.

### Don't you dare insult my carmel vanilla skim milk iced frappé!
I just did. Deal with it.
