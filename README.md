Remember 2 - The Smart Reminder App


## Notes about the repo:
### - Audio -
This folder contains sounds that were purchased from AudioJungle and are not to be used for personal use without payment to the original source. If you abuse this and use these sounds for private or public use then you are breaking the user purchase agreement of both federal copyright and the EULA of AudioJungle and could be fined accordingly.

### - Frameworks -
These frameworks are *not* created by Solar Pepper Studios and/or Keeton Feavel and are copyright / all rights reserved their respective owners (this applies to Pods too, however, these are for sure open source code and can be found on Github.) If you abuse the APIs or frameworks in such a way that it violates the EULA of the respective owners, then you are personally accountable for such abuse, not Solar Pepper Studios and/or Keeton Feavel.

### Open Source License
This code has been made open source for various reasons and is a fully functioning app that is available in the iOS App Store. However, Solar Pepper Studios and/or Keeton Feavel is/are not responsible for any damages to your equipment if you compile the source code yourself. This code has been made available for research and as such, if you plan to use Remember or Remember 2 for personal use, please buy a license to do so by downloading the application in the iOS App Store.

### What is Remember?
Remember is a notes taking app that combines the powers of reminders, photos, and locations all into a single entity. It's designed to be user friendly and powerful. (It doesn't quite meet this goal 100% of the time to be completely honest.)

### Why put this on Github if it's in the App Store?
Because in all honesty, nobody uses Remember and I would rather have it open source an be willing to let people view my code and possibly collaborate to make Remember better.

### Why keep it in the App Store then?
Until Remember actually gets to a point that it provides an experience unlike any other app, then there isn't much of a point in keeping it private. If you'd like to use the application for personal use, then I'm relying on you to use the honor system and pay a measly 99¢ for Remember. That's nearly 4x's less than your super fancy carmel vanilla skim milk iced frappé that you get at Starbucks.

### Don't you dare insult my carmel vanilla skim milk iced frappé!
I just did. Deal with it.

### What's the Remember-Watchtower branch for?
All things iOS 10+ related. It basically serves as the "beta" branch for remember.
